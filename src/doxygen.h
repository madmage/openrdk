\mainpage OpenRDK

OpenRDK is a modular software framework focused on rapid development of distributed robotic systems.
It has been designed following users' advice and has been in use within our group for several years.
By now OpenRDK has been successfully applied in diverse applications with heterogeneous robots and as we believe it is fruitfully usable by others we are releasing it as open source.

The OpenRDK can be downloaded from SourceForge.net: http://openrdk.sourceforge.net/
If you find any problem or you want more help, you can subscribe to the OpenRDK Support Mailing List: http://groups.google.com/group/openrdk.
