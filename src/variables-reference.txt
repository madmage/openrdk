                     set by setenv

CMAKE AUTOMATIC VARIABLES:
   PROJECT_BINARY_DIR
   OpenRDK_BINARY_DIR
                     full path to build directory of the project

   PROJECT_NAME      project name
   PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR
   OpenRDK_SOURCE_DIR
   CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR
                     top level source directory of the project

CMAKE VARIABLES:
   OpenRDK_CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
                     the directory where the OpenRDK cmake modules reside, i.e., $RDK_ROOT/src/build_tools/cmake,
                     it is set by $RDK_ROOT/src/CMakeLists.txt
   OpenRDK_VERSION   the current version in dotted form (e.g., 2.1.2), set by $RDK_ROOT/src/CMakeLists.txt
   OpenRDK_ROOT      same as RDK_ROOT bash variable, set by $RDK_ROOT/src/CMakeLists.txt
   OpenRDK_OUTPUT_TREE
                     same as RDK_BUILD_DIR bash variable, set by $RDK_ROOT/src/CMakeLists.txt
   OpenRDK_ARCH
                     architecture (if not cross-compiling, it is "generic", otherwise it contains a string specifying the
                     cross-compiling architecture); set by $RDK_ROOT/src/CMakeLists.txt
   RDKCORE_LIBRARIES the rdkcore library, that can be linked by using TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES, set by $RDK_ROOT/src/CMakeLists.txt
   RDKCORE_INCLUDE_DIR
                     the include directory with rdkcore includes (that should be included with #include<rdkcore/whatever.h>), this can be specified using INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES, it is set by $RDK_ROOT/src/CMakeLists.txt

   RDKCORE_LDFLAGS
                     flags used to compile using rdkcore, it is a combination of *_LINK_DIRECTORIES and *_LIBRARIES, for software compiled using standard Makefile; set by $RDK_ROOT/src/CMakeLists.txt
   RDKCORE_CPPFLAGS
                     flags used to compile using rdkcore, it is used as combination of *_INCLUDE_DIR and *_DEFINITIONS, for software compiled using standard Makefile; set by $RDK_ROOT/src/CMakeLists.txt
   OpenRDK_FINDOPENRDK_CMAKE
                     full path to the include cmake file for external projects; set by $RDK_ROOT/src/CMakeLists.txt
   RDK_INSIDE        it is 1 if we are inside the OpenRDK build dir, otherwise it means we are compiling an external project
