// it is better to declare some define to be used as property names, in order to avoid misspelling in strings,
// declare here those defines for all your properties and use these; for example:

#define PROPERTY_IN_IMAGE "in/image"
#define PROPERTY_OUT_IMAGE "out/image"
#define PROPERTY_ACTION "params/action"
