// it is better to declare some define to be used as property names, in order to avoid misspelling in strings,
// declare here those defines for all your properties and use these; for example:

#define PROPERTY_SERVER_PORT "params/serverPort"
#define PROPERTY_WEBPAGES_DIR "params/webPagesDir"
#define PROPERTY_WEBPAGES_ENABLED "params/webPagesEnabled"
#define PROPERTY_WEBPAGES_LIST_ALLOWED "params/webPagesListAllowed"
