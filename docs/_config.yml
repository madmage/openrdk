# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values

# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  OpenRDK is a modular software framework focused on rapid development of distributed robotic systems.
  It has been designed following users' advice and has been in use within our group for several years.
  By now OpenRDK has been successfully applied in diverse applications with heterogeneous robots and
  as we believe it is fruitfully usable by others we are releasing it as open source.
